## ðŸ”— [232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/description/)

## Intuition

- Take two queues s1(main) and s2(helper).
- Take head variable to store head(first Out Element)
- if s1 is empty then initialize head and Add new element in s1 .
- To pop put all element of s1 to s2 . Remove s2 top element. , initialize head and put all element of s2 to s21 .

## What is Amortized O(1) time complexity ?

Amortized O(1) time complexity means that over a series of operations, the average time taken per operation is constant, regardless of the number of operations performed. It's like saying that on average, each operation takes the same amount of time, no matter how many operations you perform.

Let's explain this with the example of piggy banks. Imagine you have two piggy banks: one small and one large.

- Small Piggy Bank: This piggy bank can hold a limited number of coins before it gets full. When you insert a coin into the small piggy bank, it's a simple and quick operation. However, when the piggy bank gets full, you need to transfer the coins to a larger piggy bank, which takes more time.
- Large Piggy Bank: This piggy bank is much bigger and can hold many more coins than the small one. Inserting a coin into the large piggy bank also takes a constant amount of time, just like the small one.
  Now, let's say you start putting coins into the small piggy bank. Initially, each insertion operation is quick and takes constant time, let's say 1 second. However, when the small piggy bank gets full, you need to transfer all the coins to the large piggy bank. This transfer operation might take longer because it involves moving a larger number of coins, let's say 10 seconds.

But, if you look at the average time taken per insertion operation over a series of insertions, it remains constant. Even though some operations (like transferring coins to the large piggy bank) might take longer, they happen infrequently compared to the quick insertion operations into the small piggy bank.

So, in this example, the amortized time complexity of inserting a coin into the piggy banks is O(1), meaning that on average, each insertion operation takes constant time, regardless of whether the small piggy bank gets full and requires transferring coins to the large one.

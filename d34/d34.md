## ðŸ”— [146. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

### What is LRU Cache ?

Imagine you have a small box where you can keep things you might need later. But, this box can only hold a limited number of items. Now, let's say you have more things to put in the box than it can hold.

The Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache is like this box. It's a special memory storage system that keeps track of the items you use often and those you don't use much.

Here's how it works:

1. **Limited Space**: The LRU Cache can only store a fixed number of items. Once it's full, if you want to add something new, you have to remove something old.

2. **Tracking Usage**: Every time you use or access an item in the cache, it's marked as the most recently used. This way, the cache knows which items you're currently using.

3. **Removing the Least Recently Used**: When the cache is full and you want to add a new item, it kicks out the least recently used item to make space. This is because if you haven't used something for a while, you might not need it again soon.

So, an LRU Cache helps you manage limited space by keeping track of what you've used recently and making room for new things by removing the least recently used items. It's like having a smart, space-saving storage box!

## Code

### Using LinkedHashMap :

```java
class LRUCache {
    Map<Integer,Integer> map ;
    int capacity ;

    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        map = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        this.capacity =capacity;
    }

    public int get(int key) {
       if(map.containsKey(key)){
           Integer value = map.get(key);
           map.remove(key);
           map.put(key, value);
           return value ;
       }
       return -1 ;
    }

    public void put(int key, int value) {
        if(map.containsKey(key)){
            map.remove(key);
            map.put(key, value);
        }else{
             if(map.size()<capacity){
                map.put(key, value);
             }else{
                Iterator<Integer> iterator =  map.keySet().iterator();
                map.remove(iterator.next());
                map.put(key, value);
             }
        }
    }
}

```

### Using removeEldestEntry method of LinkedHashMap :

```java
class LRUCache extends LinkedHashMap<Integer, Integer> {

    private int capacity;

    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        // Using default initial capacity and loadFactor
        super(16, 0.75f, true);
        this.capacity = capacity;
    }

    public int get(int key) {
        return super.getOrDefault(key, -1);
    }

    public void put(int key, int value) {
        super.put(key, value);
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry eldest) {
        return super.size() > this.capacity;
    }
}
```

### What does super(16, 0.75f, true);(Contructor) line mean :

1. **Initial Capacity (16)**: This parameter sets the initial capacity of the `LinkedHashMap`. It specifies the initial number of buckets that the map can hold. In this case, it's set to 16. This value determines the initial size of the internal array used to store the key-value pairs.

2. **Load Factor (0.75f)**: The load factor is a measure of how full the map can be before it's resized to accommodate more elements. It's a decimal value between 0 and 1. When the number of entries exceeds the product of the load factor and the current capacity, the map will be resized and rehashed to maintain efficiency. In this case, it's set to 0.75, which means the map will be resized(Lets say 32) when it's approximately 75% full (means 12 elements in map would be there).

3. **Access Order (true)**: This parameter specifies the ordering mode of the map. When set to `true`, the map will be ordered based on the access order, meaning that the most recently accessed entries will be moved to the end of the map. This is important for implementing the LRU (Least Recently Used) functionality. By default, `LinkedHashMap` uses insertion order, but setting this parameter to `true` enables access-ordering.

### Using HashMap and Doubly Linked List:

```java
    class LRUCache {

        class Node {
            int key;
            int value;
            Node next;
            Node prev;

            public Node(int key, int value) {
                this.key = key;
                this.value = value;
            }
        }

        Node head = new Node(0, 0);
        Node tail = new Node(0, 0);
        Map<Integer, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
        int capacity;

        public LRUCache(int capacity) {
            map = new HashMap<>();
            this.capacity = capacity;
            head.next = tail;
            tail.prev = head;
        }

        public int get(int key) {
            if (map.containsKey(key)) {
                Node node = map.get(key);
                remove(node);
                insert(node);
                return node.value;
            }
            return -1;
        }

        public void put(int key, int value) {
            if (map.containsKey(key)) {
                remove(map.get(key));
            }
            if (map.size() == capacity) {
                remove(tail.prev);
            }
            insert(new Node(key, value));
        }

        private void insert(Node node) {
            map.put(node.key, node);
            Node nextNode = head.next;

            head.next = node;
            node.prev = head;

            node.next = nextNode;
            nextNode.prev = node;
        }

        private void remove(Node node) {
            map.remove(node.key);
            node.prev.next = node.next;
            node.next.prev = node.prev;
        }
    }
```
